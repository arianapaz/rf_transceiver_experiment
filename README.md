# Exploring Vulnerabilities of PKE Systems with Simulated RF Devices

## Description
This project aims to replicate vulnerabilities of modern RFID security systems, more specifically, those used for passive keyless entry (PKE) in modern vehicles. The goal is to conduct several experiments to demonstrate the existing flaws of PKE systems. Hence, we will emulate PKE systems by building RFID devices using: Raspberry Pis, RF-433-MHZ, F/F cables, and some code in Python for creating the encryption protocol.

## Hardware
To recreate a PKE system we will need the following hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Power Adapter
- Micro SD (with at least 16GB)
- Female to Female jumper cables (6 cables total)
- 433 MHz Transceiver

## Hardware Setup
- IN PROGRESS

## Software
- [rpi-rf](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-rf/): Python module for sending and receiving signals on Raspberry Pi.

## Experiments
- IN PROGRESS
